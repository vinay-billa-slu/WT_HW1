The place was packed, so much there was only 1 menu left when we arrived for our reservation.  We had another engagement that evening and Brittany was able to get us in and out with salads, main course, wine, and bread in 50 minutes.  This allowed us to be on time for our second event of the evening.

Food was great and the ambiance is little Italy in Cleveland so it's hard to say anything negative!","Sep 7, 2025","","","0"

It was so good that we came back again the next night! The food is incredible and the service was amazing. Our waitress, Jen, was so kind and warm and Lorna was the sweetest. If you have yet to try this place, please do...you won't be disappointed.","Aug 12, 2025","","","0"

Moved here a couple of months ago and am still new to the food scene. Heard about this place through a coworker (who said it was the best spot in Little Italy).

We ordered the honey and ricotta bread course...still thinking about that dish...the bread was buttery, garlicky, SOFT yet crispy. The whipped ricotta was insanely delicious. We split the ragu, frutti di mare, and scallops. The scallops were 10/10 best bite of the night. Ragu was fantastic. That sauce tasted like it had been simmering for hours. The frutti di mare was OK (not sure if squid ink pasta is my thing yet), but the sauce had a nice spice and a bold, seafood-forward flavor.

Portions were so generous and pricing was honestly fair for this 2025 economy. The ambience was classic, no-fuss Italian fare: white tablecloths, Frank Sinatra , humble staff. And best part is it felt fancy and yet no one would judge you for wearing whatever you wanted.

Mia Bella is no-frills, fantastic Italian cooking. We will be back...and back...many times.","Sep 9, 2025","7 Italian Food reviews","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xUSLJ6jz1Tx_QE4sL-K1Sw/348s.jpg

On top of that, our food arrived cold, which made the meal even more underwhelming.

I had high hopes for this restaurant, but between the lack of attentiveness and poor execution, it felt like we weren't valued as guests. Definitely not worth the price or the hype.","Aug 31, 2025","","","1"

Checked with hostess and she said she would see if she could get us in early,  which we appreciated. Left phone number and walked the area. 15 mins git a call and we got seated 45 mins ahead of reservation!  Thank you very much.
Now the VERY disappoiting part of the evening. When the server, Gizem came to our table, W3, she first asked if we wanted water or sparkling water. We elected sparkling water. Took the appetizer and drink order and left. Came back with two bottles of sparkling water and then took the dinner orders. I chose the Cheese Tortellini and my wife asked about the Short Rib Bolognese. Server asked my wife if she wanted the Ragu, which was much better. My wife said yes, not knowing it was a completely different dish, which the server never explained. Not only that, the server did not state the specials nor their respective costs.  Also our dinner partners also had the same selections on sparkling water and the Short Rib Bolognese, then Ragu changes.
The dishes were excellent, served hot and quickly after placing orders.
Finished and received our bills! With the server NOT TELLING each of us the additional costs for sparkling waters and two RAGU dishes instead of the original plates of Short Rib Bolognese, this server inflated each bill by $30!!! No $30 will not break me, but the way the padding of the dishes, is and was, highly deceptive. This does not present Mia Bella in a good light for future visits or recommendations.AND I'm not even going in on charging me a processing fee for using my credit card!!","Jun 22, 2025","16 Italian Food reviews","","0"

I went on a Tuesday evening and there were still a good amount of customers, so l can see why a reservation may be needed for a Friday or weekend. The spicy sauce was just the right about of spice, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The only critique I have is that some of the peas that were served with the dish was quite undercooked and starchy/hard so it slightly ruined the texture of the dish for me which is why I had to knock it down 1 star:/ my server was very nice and my food came out quickly.","Aug 4, 2025","9 Italian Food reviews","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b6aSjzoBMzby8wN-kQyhUg/348s.jpg

We ordered oysters, sautéed calamari, spaghetti bolognese, and steak all so delicious we cleared our plates.","Sep 10, 2025","","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HBgsDOJfAzy7L-tr1zC8KQ/348s.jpg","0"

We started with the burratta salad which was so yummy. Then we shared the  Chef's Favorite pizza which was cooked perfectly and had a subtle little kick to it. Next we shared a fantastic chicken piccata which Candace had the chef make with boneless chicken breast. We topped all that off with a creme brûlée that was the best we've ever had. The only thing I would change is the location of the table which was in a very high traffic spot next to the bar. Otherwise 5 stars!","Aug 11, 2025","22 Italian Food reviews","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W1QBUneGx7uhPNpTok0-OA/348s.jpg

The crispy Brussels sprouts weren't crispy but they were still unbelievably great! Super duper flavorful- grilled flavor, salt, some balsamic and sun dried tomatoes. Just great. The shrimp saganaki was beautiful and flavorful. Super rich tomato cream sauce drowning large shrimp over several slices of robust halloumi cheese. The chef's favorite pizza was unremarkable. It had a rather dry overly chewy crust and was lacking in cheese but did have enough spicy sausage and onion topping.","Jul 21, 2025","40 Italian Food reviews","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/csGAOdLNCetSCkRpasJB2w/348s.jpg

You won't find a better meatball for the appetizer. Our waiter Yaseen was absolutely incredible. Everything that he suggested was absolutely amazing. One of the best dining experiences in a long time. Keep up the great work!","Aug 3, 2025","","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iF50qCyQI0Q2jhTl6QOBCw/348s.jpg","0"
