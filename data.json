We had another engagement that evening and Brittany was able to get us in and out with salads, main course, wine, and bread in 50 minutes.  This allowed us to be on time for our second event of the evening.Food was great and the ambiance is little Italy in Cleveland so it's hard to say anything negative!",

Heard about this place through a coworker (who said it was the best spot in Little Italy).We ordered the honey and ricotta bread course...still thinking about that dish...the bread was buttery, garlicky, SOFT yet crispy. The whipped ricotta was insanely delicious. We split the ragu, frutti di mare, and scallops. The scallops were 10/10 best bite of the night. Ragu was fantastic. That sauce tasted like it had been simmering for hours. The frutti di mare was OK (not sure if squid ink pasta is my thing yet), but the sauce had a nice spice and a bold, seafood-forward flavor.Portions were so generous and pricing was honestly fair for this 2025 economy. The ambience was classic, no-fuss Italian fare: white tablecloths, Frank Sinatra , humble staff. And best part is it felt fancy and yet no one would judge you for wearing whatever you wanted.Mia Bella is no-frills, fantastic Italian cooking. We will be back...and back...many times.",

Checked with hostess and she said she would see if she could get us in early,  which we appreciated. Left phone number and walked the area. 15 mins git a call and we got seated 45 mins ahead of reservation!  Thank you very much.Now the VERY disappoiting part of the evening. When the server, Gizem came to our table, W3, she first asked if we wanted water or sparkling water. We elected sparkling water. Took the appetizer and drink order and left. Came back with two bottles of sparkling water and then took the dinner orders. I chose the Cheese Tortellini and my wife asked about the Short Rib Bolognese. Server asked my wife if she wanted the Ragu, which was much better. My wife said yes, not knowing it was a completely different dish, which the server never explained. Not only that, the server did not state the specials nor their respective costs.  Also our dinner partners also had the same selections on sparkling water and the Short Rib Bolognese, then Ragu changes.The dishes were excellent, served hot and quickly after placing orders.Finished and received our bills! With the server NOT TELLING each of us the additional costs for sparkling waters and two RAGU dishes instead of the original plates of Short Rib Bolognese, this server inflated each bill by $30!!! No $30 will not break me, but the way the padding of the dishes, is and was, highly deceptive. This does not present Mia Bella in a good light for future visits or recommendations.AND I'm not even going in on charging me a processing fee for using my credit card!!",

I went on a Tuesday evening and there were still a good amount of customers, so l can see why a reservation may be needed for a Friday or weekend. The spicy sauce was just the right about of spice, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The only critique I have is that some of the peas that were served with the dish was quite undercooked and starchy/hard so it slightly ruined the texture of the dish for me which is why I had to knock it down 1 star:/ my server was very nice and my food came out quickly.",

Next we shared a fantastic chicken piccata which Candace had the chef make with boneless chicken breast. We topped all that off with a creme brûlée that was the best we've ever had. The only thing I would change is the location of the table which was in a very high traffic spot next to the bar. Otherwise 5 stars!",

Compared to other restaurants on the block like Mama Santes and Trattoria, which offer similar food at much more reasonable prices, this place feels overpriced for what you get.They don't even provide their bread and dipping oil anymore unless you pay extra, which just adds to the feeling that they've cut back on service while raising prices. The quality has stayed the same--if not declined from when I had visited a year ago--but the cost keeps going up.There are better options nearby for the same experience at a better price.",

On that strip, it's pretty much valet parking only. My recommendation, if you go out ~0.3 miles of the strip, there are plenty of street parking in front of the residences that you can use. Just park there and it's a straight shot walk down the sidewalk to the strip.We get there, no reservation, and they seat us immediately. Our waitress is amazing! Tells us about specials, quick to serve, great service all around. I got a glass of red, some oysters, the filet, and bread to start. Everything was tasty. Th is place is great and if you're in the area and want to get some nice dining, for Cleveland, check it out.",

The dining room is comfortable and we had a table by the windows. For a light desert we shared an Affogato.  In our opinion Mia Bella is a treasure in Cleveland's Little Italy.",

Meatballs a little tougher than I usually prefer, but the shrimp saganaki was fabulous, could drink that sauce, and the eggplant was also very good. The marinara was very fresh. Bread was to die for as well, great texture!Entrees at the table included risotto, pesto bucatini, Caesar salad, pepperoni pizza and I had the cheese tortellini with shrimp. It was very good, I do feel I've had better versions of this at other places but I enjoyed and took home leftovers. Pesto bucatini and the pizza were also highlights on the table.It was a bit loud in there but it was a cool vibe! They brought out cassata cake to end the meal which was solid, could've used a little more custard but very good.",

Mia Bella was crowded but the service never slacked. After reading off the specials and ordering a few bottles of wine we got started with bread, soups, mussels and fresh octopus salad. At this point in the evening one could be full, but not at Mia Bella, you must eat!The rigatoni with meat sauce was full of flavor, especially with the addition of meatballs on the side. The clam linguine was fresh, light and delicious. Now to the branzino, cooked perfectly, where the fish comes clean from the filet. Dessert and coffee were fantastic, cheesecake and crème brûlée are a no brainer, you are in Little Italy, dessert is necessary.Great atmosphere, friendly and professional service, and amazing food, so make that reservation.",

Service was very friendly and almost over serving. We always had water, checked in on with everything we got, plates removed quickly when done. They were on top of it. Ambiance was very nice. It's a white table cloth kind of place. The paper over the table cloth for us was a nice touch because we had our toddler with us. Which was a star with all the wait staff who loved interacting with her.",

The food was amazing.  I started with the grilled octopus appetizer, which was amazing. As my meal I had the Speciale and the chicken and fresh veggies were amazing for $29.99. The ambiance was prefect with light music and intimate lighting.  The service was also amazing with multiple people helping with the table service.  Would highly recommend.",
